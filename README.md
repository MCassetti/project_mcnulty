## Project Mcnulty: Classification

#### Problem Statement 
I want to predict if I can classify songs that I like or dislike.
Although I like a range of music, I would like to explore if there
is some hidden features that can guide my musical perferences.
#### Data 
I will take my own personal music library, which I will label 
as like or dislike. I will attempt to do this will my itunes library, 
however I may need to supplement this with other data sets. 
  
#### Features
Will use python which has several excellent modules(LibROSA,LibXtract,and Aubio for example) that can
take raw data files and extract tonal, spectral, and rythmic features.
I will build a SQL database so that if I come across other features from 
labelled data off the internet, I will be able to join this with my existing data base.


#### Models
K-NN, LR, DT, NB, RF (RNN)
